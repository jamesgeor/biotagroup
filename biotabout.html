<p>In phylogenetics, biota is a synonym of life, the highest taxonomic superdomain in
    which all life on Earth is classified at.</p>

<p>Biota Group was incorporated in Oslo, Norway, 1931 by three brothers with special interest in
    biological research, phylogenetics and humanitarianism. Spanning more than a century of continuous
    existence in the field of medicine and research, Biota established itself in multiple,
    interdisciplinary fields, ever-forming and influencing our group's goal: the redefinition
    of humanity and the establishment of a post-scarcity world with global and most affordable access not
    only to healthcare but also well-being, self-improvement and transcendence of
    biological contstraints.  
</p>

<p>Our group, loyal to the beliefs and ideology of the founders of Biota, incorporates the most
    advanced, experimental and cutting-edge techniques and practices for the continuous
    benefit of mankind and offers the freedom the modern human craves for, bulldozing the limitations of
    Earth's evolution.
