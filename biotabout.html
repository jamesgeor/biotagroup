<h1> <span>We Are Biota.</span> <span>|</span> <span>We Are Life.</span> <span>|</span> <span>We Are All.</span></h1>
<p>In phylogenetics, <span>biota</span> is a synonym of life, the highest taxonomic superdomain in
    which all life on Earth is classified at.</p>

<p>Biota Group was incorporated in Oslo, Norway, 1931 by three brothers with special interest in
    biological research, phylogenetics and humanitarianism. Spanning more than a century of continuous
    existence in the field of medicine and research, Biota established itself in multiple,
    interdisciplinary fields, ever-forming and influencing our group's goal: the redefinition
    of humanity and the establishment of a post-scarcity world with global and most affordable access not
    only to healthcare but also well-being, self-improvement and transcendence of
    biological contstraints.  
</p>

<p>Our group, loyal to the beliefs and ideology of the founders of Biota, incorporates the most
    advanced, experimental and sometimes controversial techniques and practices for the continuous
    benefit of mankind and offers the freedom the modern man craves for, bulldozing the limitations of
    Earth's evolution.
